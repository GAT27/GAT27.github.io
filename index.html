                    <p>Senior Design Project at Georgia Tech that consisted of four team
                    members and a supervisor with the goal of creating a project to motivate
                    students in STEM schools to pursue a career in engineering. It was decide
                    that we would create an autonomous playing machine that would not only
                    play Connect 4 against another person, but would also be semi-portable.</p>

                        is further divided into the feeder and the playing field. With the linear
                        actuator already attained, I created a test loader to see how pieces
                        would fall, along with a makeshift base structure made out of K'NEX to
                        test the integrity and swivel points of the concept before continuing

                        <div><p>The circuit and PCB was designed by Andrew and testing was done by
                        Zahiduzzaman and myself. The structure is controlled by a Raspberry Pi
                        (model A) and the entire circuitry is powered by a 12V power outlet. While
                        the actuator needs the 12V to operate, a voltage regulator is used to
                        lower the voltage down to 5V to allow proper operation of the Raspberry
                        Pi, the 2 servos, and the H-bridge motor driver. The motor driver allows
                        the current to the actuator to be reversed when needed to allow left and
                        right movement of the actuator. There is also a micro USB port to
                        attach a screen and keyboard for debugging.</p>

                    <div>
                        <div><p>In order for the C4 Bot to play, it uses a camera to poll (look at)
                        the board and see that it is empty and 2 LEDs, green to go and red to
                        wait, to signal the player when to start (player always goes first).
                        When it detects an "appropriate" board change (appropriate as in there
                        is one additional red piece added from its last state), it will see where
                        the piece is and calculate where to put its own piece. Andrew worked on the
                        the computer vision using OpenCV and coding threshold values for detecting
                        red, yellow, and blue, and an array of the slots based on hard coded positions
                        of the camera view. While there were other methods of approach and even a
                        suggested use of K-means for detection, due to the time limit and limited
                        processing power, this was our best approach, though if given the chance, I
                        would of reworked this part of the code.</p>

                        <div><p>The other major code of the bot is the AI, which was handled by Tray. Built
                        in the circuit is a mode switcher to allow 3 levels of play, allowing the
                        player to change modes in game. One of the proposed AI scored each slot it
                        could take and select the slot with the highest score, but the algorithm was
                        flawed and took too long to process.</p>
                        <p>Defensive: This mode would prioritize on blocking the player on creating
                        rows of greater than 2 pieces, otherwise, it would attempt to build its own
                        rows.</p>
                        <p>Aggressive: This mode would prioritize on completing its own rows, unless
                        if the player is about to complete 4 in a row, then it will attempt to block
                        it.</p>

                    <h2>Concept for Human-Computer Interaction Device</h2>
                    <p>Semester long project for Computer Vision at Georgia Tech, the original
                    idea was to create a helmet that a user would use as a sort of augmented
                    reality, projecting an image in front of them and allowing them to
                    control information with their hand. Unfortunately, due to the scope of
                    the project, time constraints, and other complications, the project was
                    scaled down to instead demonstrate individual components.</p>

                        map from an Xbox Kinect. No additional libraries were used and the code was
                        done in Matlab. The entire algorithm was based on a research paper on
                        detecting multiple planes. I simplified it to make it look for one certain
                        sized plane, based on distance, in the center view in order for the algorithm
                        to run in real time and to send a signal if a plane is detected or not.

                        work, and rarely showed up at any of our meetings. Due to this, we were unable
                        to do enough testing with the Kinect or code the projector, nor port the plane
                        code to C++ and test it with the other components, since they were assigned
                        with me to work on this part of the project. To respect the other team members

                        space relative to the space in front of it by using trilateration with 3
                        infrared LEDs, 1st one in the bottom-left, 2nd one in the top-left, and 3rd
                        one in the bottom-right (order matters). The robot arm was originally going to
                        be the first part of the project, but there was no library for it to work with
                        the mbed, so instead the first part of the project was focused on creating and
                        testing my own library for it. The library allows for baseline sensing,
                        resets, and individual distance detection from each LEDs, though the sensor
                        allows for other modes of operations that can be programmed in.</p>

                    <h2>Personal Research to Create a Capture Card</h2>
                    <p>I will attempt to create my own capture card by using an mbed to output my
                    3DS XL video and sound signals to my computer screen. The main issue will be trying
                    to find which pins on the 3DS correspond to what, since this info is not well known
                    and is usually kept private, so I will research a bit further before I open my 3DS
                    and start testing on my own. If everything is successful, I will make this all open
                    source.</p>

                    <h2>Learning 3 Languages and More</h2>
                    <p>So I decided to make a website and learn the basics of setting one up.
                    My main reason was to setup a matchmaking server, then I decided to make
                    a personal site over it. What it became was me registering a name, renting
                    a VPS to host, setting up the VPS to actually allow it to host (LAMP
                    stack), forwarding the name to the server, then realizing to setup iptables
                    to allow access, then connecting an IDE to the server to allow full file
                    access and to push updates. Then I started coding.</p>
